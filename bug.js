The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the data you are trying to access is not available yet. This can happen if you are trying to access data from a database before it has finished loading, or if you are trying to access data that does not exist.  This often manifests as a null pointer exception or undefined error, depending on the language you're using. For example, in JavaScript, attempting to access a property of a null or undefined object will throw an error.  Here's an example where the asynchronous nature of Firebase data retrieval leads to an error:
```javascript
// Incorrect way to access data
db.ref('users/123').once('value', (snapshot) => {
  const username = snapshot.val().username; // Error if snapshot.val() is null
  console.log(username);
});
```
